# ESP32_Xiaomi-Mijia-LYWSD03MMC
Read data from Xiaomi Mijia LYWSD03MMC Bluetooth 4.2 Temperature Humidity sensor.  
There can be done a lot more with that sensor. It stores highest and lowest values at hour level, has an integrated realtime clock and a few things more like changing the values for the comfort icon on the display. Credits go to jaggil who investigated on this and documented it well. You find the results here https://github.com/JsBergbau/MiTemperature2/issues/1 Just search for jaggil.
